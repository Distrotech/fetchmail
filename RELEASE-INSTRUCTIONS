To do a release:

- Update NEWS, configure.ac, and fetchmail.man, with release number & date.

- Run "perl dist-tools/makerelease.pl" - this entails "make distcheck".

- Commit all files to the VCS (Git).

- Tag the new release with a signed tag.

- cd to ~/public_html/fetchmail and edit index.html for the new tarballs
  and NEWS files and last update.

- These would be done automatically by makerelease.pl:
  - Upload sig and tarball to ~/public_html/fetchmail/
  - Upload sig and tarball to ftp.berlios.de:/incoming/ and release

- Update the fetchmail website for version, link to release nodes
  (update release_id) and last update, commit, and upload.

- Announce on freshmeat.
