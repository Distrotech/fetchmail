I maintain an open-source POP and IMAP client called fetchmail.  It is
widely used in the Linux and open-source community, and is probably
the single most popular remote-mail client in that world.  You can
find out more about this project at
<http://fetchmail.berlios.de/>.

In order to be able to do thorough regression testing before each release,
I collect test accounts on as many different kinds of POP3, IMAP, and
ODMR servers as possible.  Because fetchmail is strictly conformant to the 
remote-mail RFCs, many server developers have found fetchmail a useful
standards-conformance test.

I'm writing to request test accounts on your server.  I support all flavors 
of POP2, POP3, IMAP and ODMR with either plain-password, CRAM-MD5, NTLM, 
GSSAPI, or Kerberos authentication.  I also support SSL/TLS.

It would be very helpful if I could have a separate test account for
each protocol you support (that is, separate POP3, IMAP, and ODMR
accounts) so I can do automated regression testing without worrying
about mailbox race conditions.
