		README for shipper

shipper automates the tedious process of shipping a software release to
several standard places, including ibiblio, the Red Hat submission directory,
and your own hosted website.  It also knows how to post a release announcement
to freshmeat.net via freshmeat-submit.  Two auxiliary tools, buildrpms and 
rpm2lsm, build RPMs and generate LSM files from them respectively.
