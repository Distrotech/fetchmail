fetchmail 6.3.0 (not yet released officially):

# SECURITY FIXES IN THIS RELEASE
* CVE-2005-2335: The POP3 UIDL code doesn't sufficiently validate/truncate the input
  length, so a (malicious or compromised) server that sends UIDs longer
  than 128 bytes can corrupt fetchmail's stack and crash fetchmail.
  This vulnerability is remotely exploitable to inject code run in a
  root shell. Edward J. Shornock, Ludwig Nussel. fetchmail-SA-2005-01.txt
* CVE-2005-3088: fetchmailconf now changes the output file to mode 0600 BEFORE
  writing to it, so there is no window where passwords could be read by the
  world. Matthias Andree. fetchmail-SA-2005-02.txt

# MAJOR INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES
* Remove support for --netsec/-T options, the required inet6_apps library is no
  longer available.
  http://www.inner.net/pub/ipv6/ states, as of 2005-07-03: "/pub/ipv6
  Our IPv6 software is now long defunct. Please find a more modern source."
  I haven't been able to find a more modern source.  Matthias Andree
* Operating systems that do not conform to the Single Unix Specification v2
  (1997) or v3 (2001, aka IEEE Std 1003.1-2001) are no longer supported. They
  may continue to work and non-intrusive patches to support them may be
  accepted.  Matthias Andree
* The default for --smtphost is now always "localhost" regardless of
  authentication types and protocols, so as to simplify configurations for
  workstations where the SMTP daemon only listens on the loopback interface.
  Sunil Shetye & Matthias Andree

# OBSOLETION WARNINGS
* The MX and host alias lookups that fetchmail performs in multidrop mode are
  obsolete, deprecated and may be removed from a future fetchmail version
  without further notice. Their support for IPv6 (including IPv6-mapped IPv4)
  is unspecified. (MA)
* The monitor and interface options may also be removed from a future fetchmail
  version as they are not sufficiently portable. (MA)
* POP2 is obsolete. Support for POP2 may be removed from a future fetchmail
  version without further notice. (MA)

  RECENT and EXISTS counts. (MA)
* Holger Mauermann's bounce patch, to use a NULL envelope from, not
  write a Return-Path header (both to meet RFC-2821), changed From,
  added Subject header, rewording the human readable part.  Fixes Debian
  bug #316446. (MA)
* Merge Sunil Shetye's time.h handling fix. (MA)
* Merge Gerd von Egidy's patch to avoid a segfault in multidrop/received

  than one server is configured. Patch by Brian Candler. (MA)
* Honor sslcertpath setting even if sslcertck is unset. Patch by Brian
  Candler. (MA)
* SSL certificate checking fixes, don't display same error message twice
  in succession, make sure that Common Name and fingerprint checking are
  only done once. Print all validation warnings/errors even if not in
  verbose mode. Patch by Brian Candler. (MA)
* Import Bjorn Reese and Daniel Stenberg's MIT-licensed Trio 1.10 from
  http://daniel.haxx.se/projects/trio/ for systems that do not support
  snprintf or vsnprintf. (MA)

  unreadable. Use Trio where [v]snprintf is/are missing. (MA)

  - fetchmail-6.2.5-random-result.patch (uninitialized variable/opie.c)
* Revised some bogus assertions about POP3 LAST and UIDL use in the
  manual page. UIDL isn't flaky as the man page suggested, but a
  reliability feature. In fact, IMAP4 code is flaky in that it relies on
  the upstream seen flags. (MA)

  design-notes.html document. The NOTES file will contain both of them.
  Matthias Andree.
* Fix Debian bug #301964, fetchmail leaks sockets when SSL negotiation
  fails. Fix suggested Goswin Brederlow. (MA)
* Really fix Debian Bug#207919 (garbage in Received: lines when smtphost set),
  patch by Tobias Diedrich.  The 6.2.5 NEWS claimed Gregan's patch had fixed
  #207919 but it had fixed #212484 instead and #207919 remained unfixed in

  Darwin. NetBSD PR#28543 (pkg/28543). Matthias Andree.
* The RFC-822 parser no longer strips the last character of bare addresses.
  Matthias Andree
* The IP address matching code was broken and 
  1. didn't search exhaustively, but matched only the first IP address of the
  server's queryname against the IP addresses of the server name to match.
  2. didn't match IP aliases versus MX hosts.  Matthias Andree
* gettext (intl/) has been removed from the fetchmail package. Install GNU
  gettext 0.14 separately for NLS (i18n).  Matthias Andree

  fetchmailconf.py script, which is now installed in the regular python
  directory. Matthias Andree.
* The "port" option, while still understood, is being replaced by the "service"
  option, which is now supported even without --enable-inet6. Matthias Andree.
* The default distribution format is now bzip2. Matthias Andree.

  getnameinfo() and the macro AF_INET6.  Matthias Andree.
* Received: headers now enclose the for <...> destination address in angle
  brackets for consistency with Postfix.  Matthias Andree.

* Missed --port/--service/--ssl cleanups in the manual. Reminder from Thomas
  Wolff. (MA)

  compile time. This configuration mismatch now causes an error message and
  authentication failure. Found by Yves Boisjoly.  Matthias Andree
* fetchmailconf now allows expert users to choose the authorization type and
  also offers MSN and NTLM, suggested by Yves Boisjoly. Matthias Andree

  MiÅkiewicz. (MA)
* Global variable cleanup, to fix daemon mode reinitialization problems. Patch
  by Sunil Shetye. (MA)
* fetchmailconf -h documents the fetchmailconf -h option. Matthias Andree
* fetchmailconf -V now prints the fetchmailconf version. Matthias Andree

  mismatch errors. Patch by Roland Stigge, Debian Bug#201113. (MA)
* make fetchmail --silent --quit really silent, Debian Bug #229014 by Dr.
  Andreas KrÃ¼ger.  Matthias Andree
* cleanup --quit handling again (so that --silent --quit just kills the
  existing daemon, rather than continue running), and document it more clearly.
  Matthias Andree
* Print an error message if multiple "defaults" records are found in the
  configuration file.  Matthias Andree
* Bury on_exit officially - the necessary code had been missing from 6.0.0,
  6.2.0, 6.2.5.  Matthias Andree
* Exit with error if the lock file cannot be read.  Matthias Andree
* Exit with error if the lock file cannot be created exclusively, this got
  broken in a 6.2.6-pre, 6.2.5.2 and older were fine.  Matthias Andree
* Do not break some other process's lockfile in "-q" mode, but wait for the
  other process's exit.  Matthias Andree
* Man page: --sslfingerprint points user to x509(1ssl) and gives an example
  how to use it. Debian Bug#213484, Eduard Bloch. (MA)
* Try to obtain FQDN as our own host by default, rather than using "localhost".
  If hostname cannot be qualified, complain noisily and continue, unless
  Kerberos, ODMR or ETRN are used (these require a FQDN).
  Partial fix of Debian Bug#150137. Fixes Debian Bug#316454.  Matthias Andree

  Bug#320645.  Matthias Andree
* Man page: Fix Debian Bug#241883, making global options more clear. Matt
  Swift, Matthias Andree.
* When eating IMAP message trailer, don't see any line containing "OK" as the

  the qmail + Courier-IMAP problem in Debian Bug#338007. Matthias Andree
* Fix Debian Bug#317761: when trying to send a bounce message, don't bail out
  if we cannot qualify our own hostname, so we aren't losing the bounce.
  Instead, pass the buck on to the SMTP server and use our own unqualified
  hostname. Matthias Andree
