Debian: http://bugs.debian.org/ (wishlist missing)

OPEN 2 #146306	fetchmail: so called "bouncing" of mail is braindead

OPEN 2 #150137	Fetchmail does not use smtphost on bounces

OPEN 3 #201113	PATCH fetchmail is missing a check for Subject Alternative Name (TLS cert.)
		delayed - feature patch

OPEN 3 #241883	fetchmail: man page and code comments & messages are unclear on global vars and their default vals

OPEN 3 #316454	fetchmail: Puts "localhost" into Received header instead of hostname
		should use FQDN instead
		Received: from pop3.demon.co.uk by localhost with POP3 (fetchmail-6.2.5)

FDBK 2 #186739	SSL-POP3 closes connection when feeding to local SMTP takes
		too long -> fetchmail dies with signal 13
		may be long fixed since the report

FDBK 2 #312415	fetchmail: does not implement IMAP correctly
		apparently fetchmail emits protocol data when the server
		doesn't use {LENGTH} prefix on the body.

FDBK 2 #317761	fetchmail: Stops on underscore in domain part of email

FDBK 3 #286899	fetchmail: Problem with PID file
		[probably invalid and local problem with /etc/passwd]

FDBK 3 #268346	/etc/init.d/fetchmail try-restart doesn't work
FDBK 3 #294547	fetchmail: has to be manually restarted after a while
		NOTE: appears to be regular network problem?
		but might also be a FD leak (check lsof?)

FDBK 3 #314509	fetchmail: lost mail, or only calculation error?
		Perhaps the server cannot count.
		NOTE: need to review if this causes buffer overrun
		problems.

FDBK 3 #223933	fetchmail: should ignore mails that are stuck on a server

FDBK 4 #276044	/etc/default/fetchmail lying around looking important
		Probably debian-specific

INVA 3 #155827	fetchmail: transposes Delivered-To header
		no evidence this is a fetchmail bug.

INVA 3 #224564	fetchmail: passes from address [envelope!] with spaces to MTA
		reporter has single quotes in the MDA option.

INVA 3 #222510	--configdump doesn't work while daemon is running
INVA 3 #213805	--configdump doesn't work while daemon is running
		problem is Debian-specific

INVA 3 #317093	fetchmail: does not delete downloaded messages before finishing downloading everything
		Probably a misunderstanding of POP3 protocol

INVA 4 #250253	Error message "Query status=24" is meaningless
		(insufficient information, not reproducible)
