Topic:		remote code injection vulnerability in fetchmail

Author:		Matthias Andree
Version:	1.01
Announced:	2005-07-21
Type:		buffer overrun/stack corruption/code injection
Impact:		account or system compromise possible through malicious
		or compromised POP3 servers
Danger:		high: in sensitive configurations, a full system
		compromise is possible
CVE Name:	CAN-2005-2335
URL:		http://fetchmail.berlios.de/fetchmail-SA-2005-01.txt
		http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=212762

Thanks:		Edward J. Shornock (located the bug in UIDL code)
		Miloslav Trmac (pointed out 6.2.5.1 was faulty)
		Ludwig Nussel (provided minimal fix)

Affects:	fetchmail version 6.2.5.1 (denial of service)
		fetchmail version 6.2.5 (code injection)
		fetchmail version 6.2.0 (code injection)
		(other versions have not been checked)

Not affected:	fetchmail 6.2.5.2
		fetchmail 6.2.6-pre7
		fetchmail 6.3.0      (not released yet)

		Older versions may not have THIS bug, but had been found
		to contain other security-relevant bugs.

Corrected:	2005-07-22 01:37 UTC (SVN) - committed bugfix (r4157)
		2005-07-22                   fetchmail-patch-6.2.5.2 released

0. Release history

2005-07-20	1.00 - Initial announcement
2005-07-22	1.01 - Withdrew 6.2.5.1 and 6.2.6-pre5, the fix was buggy
		       and susceptible to denial of service through
		       single-byte read from 0 when either a Message-ID:
		       header was empty or the UIDL response did not
		       contain an URL.
		     - Add Credits.
		     - Add 6.2.5.1 failure details to sections 2 and 3
		     - Revise section 5 and B.

1. Background

fetchmail is a software package to retrieve mail from remote POP2, POP3,
IMAP, ETRN or ODMR servers and forward it to local SMTP, LMTP servers or
message delivery agents.

2. Problem description

The POP3 code in fetchmail-6.2.5 and older that deals with UIDs (from
the UIDL) reads the responses returned by the POP3 server into
fixed-size buffers allocated on the stack, without limiting the input
length to the buffer size. A compromised or malicious POP3 server can
thus overrun fetchmail's stack.  This affects POP3 and all of its
variants, for instance but not limited to APOP.

In fetchmail-6.2.5.1, the attempted fix prevented code injection via
POP3 UIDL, but introduced two possible NULL dereferences that can be
exploited to mount a denial of service attack.

3. Impact

In fetchmail-6.2.5 and older, very long UIDs can cause fetchmail to
crash, or potentially make it execute code placed on the stack. In some
configurations, fetchmail is run by the root user to download mail for
multiple accounts.

In fetchmail-6.2.5.1, a server that responds with UID lines containing
only the article number but no UID (in violation of RFC-1939), or a
message without Message-ID when no UIDL support is available, can crash
fetchmail.

4. Workaround

No reasonable workaround can be offered at this time.

5. Solution

Upgrade your fetchmail package to version 6.2.5.2.

This requires the download of the fetchmail-6.2.5.tar.gz tarball and the
fetchmail-patch-6.2.5.2.gz from BerliOS:

<http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1824>

To use the patch:

  1. download fetchmail-6.2.5.tar.gz (or retrieve the version you already
     had downloaded) and fetchmail-patch-6.2.5.2.tar.gz
  2. unpack the tarball: gunzip -c fetchmail-6.2.5.tar.gz | tar xf -
  3. unpack the patch: gunzip fetchmail-patch-6.2.5.2.gz
  4. apply the patch: cd fetchmail-6.2.5 ; patch -p1 <../fetchmail-patch-6.2.5.2
  5. now configure and build as usual - detailed instructions in the file
     named "INSTALL".
