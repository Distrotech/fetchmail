soon - MUST:
- BerliOS Bug #10972, Fetchmail refetches big messages repeatedly (SMTP listener
  issue)
- publish SA-2007-02 after release
- Debian Bug #475239, MIME decoder may break up words (need to quote results)
- Debian Bug #480851, stuck mail from gandi.net (IMAP; Dovecot) http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=480851
- Replace sscanf/fscanf by functions that do range checking (strtol/strtoul) :-/
  See http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=6453
- Ubuntu Launchpad Bug #64152, fetchmailconf fails if fetchmail compiled
  without res_search() since "dns" missing in "Server" typemap.
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/fetchmail/+bug/64152
- Ubuntu Launchpad Bug #151333, cannot download mail with long Cc: field
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/fetchmail/+bug/151333

soon - SHOULD:
- https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=246829 - fetchmail lost some mail
  (5XX error code in contradiction with manual?)
  also http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=471283
- allow \Deleted without \Seen, rf. 
  http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=466299
- document IMAP4 ACL requirements
- log configured server name on certificate mismatch (perhaps pay
  attention to via entries and stuff like that)
- BerliOS Bug #11576, thread on fetchmail users "Invalid SSL certificate" by
  Philip Susi, SSL negotiation does not use ERR_error_string(3ssl) to report
  errors in a readable way, we just report socket errors with no good reason.
- http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=432618
  * write a table of combinations of TLS/SSL options
- add To: header to warning mails (authfail for instance)
- Debian Bug#449179, smbutil.c:90: unicodeToString: Assertion `len+1 < sizeof
  buf' failed, from Stepan Golosunov <stepan@golosunov.pp.ru>
- Fix TOCTOU race around prc_filecheck*
- Get rid of peeking in socket.c? MSG_PEEK seems non-portable and racey.

soon - MAY:
- http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=471176
  => fetchmail: support utf-8 encoding in log file
  Revisit http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=400719
  => syslog messages are localised
  http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/11/msg01068.html

soon - after 6.3.9:
- find a solution for the "invalid header" discards message problem
  (escape headers and stuff reminder into body)
- add Message-ID: header and other SHOULD headers to warning mails?
- report multiline SMTP errors properly (sample in private mail from 
  Earl Chew, 2007-07-30T02:28)
  => requires reworking SMTP_ok to actually not only read the last line 
     of multiline replies, but buffer.

questionable:
- Convert POP3 UIDs to X-UIDL?
- fetch IMAP message in one go (fetchmail-devel by Adam Simpkins
  <simpkins@cisco.com> around Nov 2nd)?

6.4:
- revisit maximum allowed rcfile permissions, fix inconsistency
  (silently allowing g+x).
- make UID code more efficient, parsing is O(n^2), should be no worse
  than O(n log n).
- help systematic debugging
    - by making logging more strict (Postfix's msg_* as example??)
    - by adding a --loggingtest or something that emits 
      a set of test log messages at various severity levels, in order to 
      make sure people get complete logs.
    - by adding messages where fetchmail stuffed its output.
- Debian Bug #454291 fetchmail --quit: should check, that pid file 
  really contains pid of fetchmail process (Dmitry Nezhevenko)
  => use fcntl() lock?
- feature to skip first N or all messages upon first download
- download only messages whose headers match a filter (by Toby, Usenet
  Nov 2007 de.comm.software.mailserver
  Message-ID: <1195033726.123704.296060@k79g2000hse.googlegroups.com>)
- feature request by Daniel Goering <g_daniel@gmx.net> on
  fetchmail-devel 2007-11-15: populate .fetchids from current messages.
  (it'll probably be useful to limit this to "all but the 10 latest" or
  "all before date this-and-that")
- http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=374514
  "Deleting fetchids file" vs. POP3 - probably unneeded if we use IMAP UIDs.
- change SSL/TLS UI incompatibly, making it easier to use
- allow selection of SSL/TLS Ciphers
- perhaps switch to libgsasl and libgnutls (which doesn't talk SSLv2)
- make the SSL default v3 (rather than v23).
- put more hints to the FAQ (should we call it FGA?) as first support place
- make sure we print socket error messages such as connection reset by
  peer to hint users the problem is not in fetchmail
- > b) When the envelope header is specified, but it isn't found, a
  > warning is logged and the mail is forwarded to the postmaster
  > ("WARNING: Envelope header $HEADER found, cannot identify the
  > recipient.  Forwarding to the postmaster")
  Rob MacGregor 2007-03-16 Patch to the man page, fetchmail-devel@
- integrate Isaac Wilcox's test rig
- look at Tony Earnshaw's .spec file
- look at Gentoo patches
- remove dead replacement functions: strdup (Andreas Krennmair), ...
- more SMTP/LMTP error detail on message rejections even outside verbose mode.
  Ian D. Allen, fetchmail-users. Two messages with examples.
  What goes here? fetchmailrc location, server, port, user, folder, anything else?
- see if "AUTH SSH" can be made to work for POP3
- revisit BerliOS patches
- check recent list mail
- check Debian BTS and other bug trackers
- better logging (log all headers, log forward destination + method)
- check strict envelope N Received parsing,
  see mail from Admin Att on fetchmail-users
- 6.3.4-pending-deletes.patch
- fetchmail -s with running daemon complains rather than silently
  restarting daemon
- send warning message when connection fails?
- when logging to syslog, disable locale?
- check FAQ O5 - do we really prefer From: over envelope?!?
- add code to allow safe authentication schemes if TLS fails
- make APOP an authenticator, integrate with regular auto authentication
  but stuff it at the end
- allow forcing RETR (RETR vs. TOP, fetchmail-users, drbob 2008-01-11)
- use SASL?
- make logfile more useful (redirect not only in daemon mode)

DOCUMENTATION:
- Add info whether Keywords are global, server or user keywords
- consolidate multidrop documentation
